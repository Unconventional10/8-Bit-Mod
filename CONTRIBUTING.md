These are the guidelines for contributing to the project:

1) You have to first fill out the form on https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/minecraft/modding/working-on-a-mod-for-1-14-3-590618/ via a comment or a DM to AwesomeNinja886's PlanetMinecraft account.
2) The mod is based off of the books by Cube Kid. Without explicit permission from AwesomeNinja886, you MAY NOT add a feature not from the series. 
3) You may, however, use a custom name for a feature if it is not explicitly named in the books. This name must be discussed among the other developers of the mod so it is certain about what is being added.
4) The wiki should be written as professionally as possible. If any part of the wiki does not seem to be written in a professional and clear matter you may rewrite that part. ABSOLUTELY NO SPAM.
5) The mod's primary focus is for MINECRAFT FORGE, for the LATEST VERSION OF THE BASE MINECRAFT GAME. At the time of the original document, this would be Minecraft 1.14.3. Porting it to any other modloader, e.g. Fabric, MUST be discussed with the development team. Any of these ports are considered forks of the original mod and are NOT the development team's top priority. If anyone wants to make it their top priority, that's fine, but the original mod will stay on Forge.
